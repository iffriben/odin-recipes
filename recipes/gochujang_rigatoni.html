        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I stole this recipe directly from the Mob website, and you can view it <a href="https://www.mob.co.uk/recipes/sausage-gochujang-rigatoni">right here!</a>  Normally I wouldn't steal a recipe outright, but this is one that I use on a weekly basis.  It's so good and keeps so well (though it does tend to get a bit oily as leftovers.)  I've omitted some things from the original recipe that I don't include just based on my own preferences, and I converted the ingredients to standard US measurements.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 <strong>Hot Sausages</strong> (You can use mild if you don't want quite so much of a kick.)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp <strong>Butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Garlic and Onion Powder</strong> (The original website says to use a shallot, but this works just as well.)</li>
            <li>Some <strong>Minced Garlic</strong> straight from the jar</li>
            <li>1 lb <strong>Rigatoni</strong></li>
            <li>2 tbsp <strong>Gochujang</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>Heavy Cream</strong></li>
            <li>A bit of <strong>Lime Juice</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Honey</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Pepper</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Decase your sausages and fry the meat in a pan with some oil on a medium-high heat to brown it off. Deglaze with a splash of water when the bottom of the pan starts to caramelise. You want some of the caramelisation, though, as this will be crucial for the flavour of the dish.</li>
            <li>Once the sausage crumbles are caramelised and golden, remove them from the pan and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Add your butter to the pan then, once it starts to melt, add in your minced garlic and seasonings. After that, you’re going to want to go in with the gochujang and heavy cream. Grate in a bit of Parmesan and add the lime juice to the pan along with your honey. Finally, add your caramelised sausage bits back to the pan. Give it a good mix, and leave it to simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Get your pasta in salted boiling water. Once it’s al dente, drain the pasta and reserve the water. That pasta water is the key to bringing your sauce together.</li>
            <li>Add a small ladle of starchy water to your pasta and keep mixing until it’s super glossy. If you feel that the pasta needs a bit more water, add another small ladleful.</li>
            <li>Fry aasdf tablespoon of olive oil in a separate pan before tossing your breadcrumbs in. Take off heat and grate in the remaining parmesan.</li>
            <li>Top the pasta with your breadcrumbs.  Tuck in!</li>
        </ol>
