        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This is a wonderful baked ziti recipe that comes from my good friend Madi.  I make it about once a month and it's enough to last my partner and I for the better part of a week.  It travels well for lunches at work, and it's also just great for nights when I don't feel like cooking!</p>
        <p>This recipe is perfect to make on a Sunday and bring to work for lunch throughout the week, or to last a few days for dinners.  Personally, I can't stand onions, so I omit those and just use a bit of onion powder.  I also don't bother with the wine - I never happen to have the right kind on hand - but you can certainly use it to elevate the dish.</p>
        <p>Note that sometimes this recipe may yield more than will fit in my 9x13 pan - you may wish to use a bit less pasta so as not to let any go to waste, but the rest of the proportions may remain the same.</p>
